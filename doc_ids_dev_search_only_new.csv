 dependency kernel Zhou et al.(2005)	[37]	[1]	[0.6405534744262695]
(Shao and Ng, 2004) rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank.	[107, 47, 46, 172, 158, 152, 151, 106]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.5321792364120483, 1.1442530155181885, 0.9374349117279053, 0.4827781319618225, 0.46917974948883057, 0.9509128332138062, 0.711574137210846, 0.5765693187713623]
(Zhou et al., 2005), our experiments are carried out on explicit relations due to the poor inter-annotator agreement in annotation of implicit relations and their limited numbers.	[110, 147, 22]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.7754566669464111, 0.39444872736930847, 0.8916370868682861]
5.2.4 Transliterations of foreign names As described in Sproat et al.(1996): FNs are usually transliterated using Chinese character strings whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name.	[281, 280]	[1, 1]	[1.8520158529281616, 1.4196727275848389]
7 Here, we use the same set of flat features (i.e. word,.entity type, mention level, overlap, base phrase chunk- ing, dependency tree, parse tree and semantic information) as Zhou et al (20 05).	[34, 193, 93]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.4956591129302979, 0.6117955446243286, 0.6823627352714539]
A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as (Szpektor et al., 2004), (Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[1.6086206436157227]
A previous work along this line is Sproat et al.(1996), which is based on weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).	[398, -4, 87]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.7182369828224182, 0.5510969758033752, 1.7662433385849]
"According to Sproat et al. {1996) and Wu and Fung {1994), experiments show that only about 75% agreement between native speakers is to be expected on the ""correct"" segmentation, and the figure reduces as more people become involved."	[303, 348]	[1, 1]	[1.758439064025879, 0.6071997880935669]
After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to (Zhang et al., 2006).	[25, 61, 0, 150]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.629008948802948, 0.48626017570495605, 1.0300920009613037, 1.0371791124343872]
Also, the CRF model using maximum subword-based tagging (Zhang et al., 2006)	[0, 30]	[1, 1]	[0.4419381618499756, 1.478682279586792]
Although in order to achieve the best performance, it is necessary to use a proper combination of these features (Zhou et al., 2005), in this paper, we will concentrate on how to better capture the syntactic features for relation extraction.	[20, 2, 192]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.052590250968933, 0.3333587050437927, 0.300342321395874]
Although we could adapt our method for use with an automatically induced inventory, our method which uses WordNet might also be combined with one that can automatically find new senses from text and then relate these to WordNet synsets, as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) and Curran (2005) do with unknown nouns.	[147]	[1]	[0.9947013854980469]
Among them, feature-based methods (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) achieve certain success by employing a large amount of diverse linguistic features, varying from lexical knowledge, entity- related information to syntactic parse trees, dependency trees and semantic information	[192, 2, 40, 31]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.670933187007904, 0.5704861283302307, 0.6824084520339966, 1.2700849771499634]
Among these strategies, the confidence measure used to combine the results of CT and DS is a straightforward one, which is introduced in (Zhang et al., 2006a).	[58, 57]	[1, 1]	[1.1673403978347778, 1.4265104532241821]
An additional potential is to integrate automatically acquired relationships with the information found in WordNet, which seems to suffer from several serious limitations (Curran 2005), and typically overlaps to a rather limited extent with the output of automatic acquisition methods.	[1]	[1]	[0.317745566368103]
Another related task is supersense tagging (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).	[0]	[1]	[0.6680201888084412]
As (Sproat ct a.l., 1996) testify, several native Chinese speakers do not always agree on one unique tokeniza.tion for a. given sentence.	[297, 228, 16]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.3109373152256012, 0.3779698312282562, 0.4534327983856201]
As a later reﬁnement, Sekine (2005) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexicalized phrasal paraphrases for speciﬁc concepts represented by keywords.	[95]	[1]	[0.44984370470046997]
As even human judges differ when facing the task of segmenting a text into words and test corpora differ from system to system (Sproat et al. 1996), it is very difficult to compare two methods.	[297, 133, 130, 33]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.6383436322212219, 1.1214638948440552, 1.3275407552719116, 0.337434858083725]
As for paraphrase, Sekineâ€™s Paraphrase Database (Sekine, 2005) is collected using an unsupervised method, and focuses on phrases connecting two Named Entities.	[23, 3, 205]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.1917537450790405, 1.3510676622390747, 1.1917537450790405]
Bag-of-Words: These features have also been explore by Zhao and Grishman (2005) and Zhou et.al.(2005).	[37]	[1]	[1.3876477479934692]
Based on his work, Zhou et al (2005)further incorporated the base phrase chunking information and semi-automatically collected country name list and personal relative trigger word list.	[155, 102]	[1, 1]	[1.5040751695632935, 0.3493379056453705]
Besides, Zhou et al.(2005) introduce additional chunking features to enhance the parse tree features.	[195, 143, 140]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.8169542551040649, 0.3420279026031494, 0.8061028122901917]
Candidate Chinese transliterations are generated by consulting a list of characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names.As discussed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996), a subset of a few hundred characters (out of several thousand) tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating foreign names into Chinese.	[280]	[1]	[1.0133618116378784]
Chinese According to Sproat et al.(1996), most prior work in Chinese segmentation has exploited lexical knowledge bases; indeed, the authors assert that they were aware of only one previously pubÂ­ lished instance (the mutual-information method of Sproat and Shih (1990)) of a purely statistical apÂ­ proach.	[91, 89, 329]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.7163063287734985, 0.5859223008155823, 0.658962070941925]
Chinese NE recognition is much more difficult than that in English due to two major problems.The first is the word segmentation problem (Sproat et al. 96, Palmer 97).	[23, 415, 137, 459]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.42552027106285095, 0.9112083911895752, 1.1797828674316406, 0.7286669611930847]
Chinese word segmentation is a well-known problem that has been studied extensively (Wu and Fung, 1994; Sproat et al., 1996; Luo and Roukos, 1996) and it is known that human agreement is relatively low.	[137]	[1]	[0.8855661153793335]
Conventionally a word segmentation process identifies the words in input text by matching lexical entries and resolving the ambiguous matching (Chen & Liu, 1992, Sproat et al, 1996).	[115]	[1]	[0.9358574748039246]
Dang et al.(1998) modify it by adding new classes which remove the overlap between classes from the original scheme.	[110]	[1]	[1.2141609191894531]
Dang et al.(1998), for example, have refined the current classification by creating intersective classes for those verbs which share membership of more than one Levin class.	[5, 3, 44, 40, 47, 156]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.6327386498451233, 0.5561697483062744, 1.1681602001190186, 0.6439433097839355, 0.33584243059158325, 0.5286786556243896]
Data-driven paraphrase discovery methods (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pasca and Dienes, 2005; Wu and Zhou, 2003; Sekine, 2005) extends the idea of distributional similarity to phrases.	[0]	[1]	[0.5944410562515259]
Due to space limitations, we only describe the collocation features and refer the reader to (Zhou et al., 2005) for the rest of the features.	[37]	[1]	[0.9422383904457092]
Especially, although we did not concern the dependency tree and full parse tree information as other supervised methods (Miller et al., 2000; Culotta and Soresen, 2004; Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005), the incorporation of simple features, such as words and chunking information, still can provide complement information for capturing the characteristics of entity pairs.	[193, 93, 97, 34, 31]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.0754451751708984, 1.1002142429351807, 0.7923673987388611, 0.6178907155990601, 1.204689621925354]
Evaluation E C We processed news articles for an entire year in tion of maximum bipartite matching (West, 1999) on a bipartite graph GB = (VB = (Si , Sj ), EB ) 2008 by Xinhua news who publishes news in E C both English and Chinese, which were also used with edge weights that are defined by TS . The maximum bipartite matching finds a subset of by Kim et al.(2011) and Shao and Ng (2004).	[81, 83]	[1, 1]	[0.3928998112678528, 0.3588511645793915]
Feature Template Description f) in(str, subword-list) is str in subword list g) in(str, confident-word-list) is str in confident-word list Table 2: Subword Features for CRF-based Segmenter dure for constructing a subword list is similar to the one used in (Zhang et al., 2006).	[78]	[1]	[0.3641347885131836]
Feature-based methods (Kambhatla, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Zhao and Grishman, 20052 ) for this task employ a large amount of diverse linguistic features, such as lexical, syntactic and semantic features.	[40, 17, 192, 2, 60]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.4690999686717987, 0.7692418098449707, 0.7822754383087158, 0.5841897130012512, 0.871424674987793]
First of all, it is really difficult to build a reliable and objective gold-standard given the fact that there is only 70% agreement between native speakers on this task (Sproat et al., 1996).	[93]	[1]	[0.3187946677207947]
For a discussion of recent Chinese segmentation work, see Sproat et al. {1996).	[402]	[1]	[0.47061657905578613]
For each pair of entity mentions, we extract and compute various lexical and syntactic features, as employed in a state-of-the-art relation extraction system (Zhou et al., 2005).	[60, 192, 39]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.8272919654846191, 0.9311988353729248, 0.8837583661079407]
For this purpose, our system is based on a combination of subword-based tagging method (Zhang et al., 2006) and accessor variety-based new word recognition method (Feng et al., 2004).	[151, 0]	[1, 1]	[0.7806415557861328, 0.5838907361030579]
Furthermore, when the UPST (FPT) kernel is com bined with a linear state-of-the-state feature- based kernel (Zhou et al., 2005) into a composite one via polynomial interpolation in a setting similar to Zhou et al.	[37]	[1]	[0.7020254731178284]
Gold standards, however, 435 cannot be uniﬁed into a single standard (Fung and Wu 1994; Sproat et al. 1996).	[412, 410, 408, 314, 318, 313, 317, 128]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.85334712266922, 0.7144818902015686, 0.4075266718864441, 0.4189952611923218, 0.41293978691101074, 0.8352492451667786, 0.8659774661064148, 0.6893222332000732]
How ever, it is difficult for them to effectively capture struc tured parse tree information (Zhou et al 2005), which is critical for further performance improvement in relation extraction.	[193, 5, 3, 211, 42, 195, 41, 4]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.4891480207443237, 1.1626856327056885, 1.0067405700683594, 1.123249888420105, 0.5285422801971436, 0.4432431161403656, 0.31578895449638367, 0.5717083215713501]
However it is reported (Zhou et al., 2005; Kambhatla, 2004) that hierarchical structured syntactic features contributes less to performance improvement.	[41, 3, 20, 18]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.7694706916809082, 0.7487438321113586, 0.3741511106491089, 0.5213990211486816]
However, detailed research (Zhou et al., 2005) shows that itâ€™s difficult to extract new effective features to further improve the extraction accuracy.	[38, 5, 211, 42, 216]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.0494900941848755, 0.5105466246604919, 0.4691561162471771, 0.3929210305213928, 0.4776042401790619]
In Chinese text segmentation there are three basic approaches (Sproat et al. 1996): pure heuristic, pure statistical, and a hybrid of the two.	[89, 91]	[1, 1]	[1.0866570472717285, 0.8228757977485657]
In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words, we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams, similar to those used for Chinese segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996).	[162, 245]	[1, 1]	[0.49236974120140076, 0.9015517234802246]
In addition, there is no commonly accepted standard for evaluating the performance of word extraction methods, and it is very hard to decide whether a word is meaningful or not (Sproat et al. 1996).	[191]	[1]	[0.9589362740516663]
In contrast, some research have been focused on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al., 1997), (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003), (Villarejo et al., 2005), (Curran, 2005), (Kohomban and Lee, 2005) and (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).	[229]	[1]	[0.7315334677696228]
In many cases, the additional information that VerbNet provides for each class has caused it to subdivide, or use intersections of, Levinâ€™s original classes, adding an additional level to the hierarchy (Dang et al. 1998).	[110, 109, 52]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.2739371061325073, 0.5740228891372681, 0.3529621660709381]
In such languages, words are segmented using more advanced techniques, which can be categorized into three methods: (i) Dictionary/lexicon based approaches (ii) Linguistic knowledge based approaches (iii) Machine learning based approaches/statistical approaches (Haruechaiyasak et al., 2008) Longest matching (Poowarawan, 1986; Richard Sproat, 1996) and maximum matching (Sproat et al., 1996; Haizhou & Baosheng, 1998) are examples of lexicon based approaches.	[89, 104, 114, 120]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.3769830465316772, 0.8823974132537842, 0.564892053604126, 0.6931223273277283]
In the same way, most NLP systems like information retrieval (Sekine, 2005) or question answering (Duclaye et al., 2003), based on pattern recognition, can be improved by a paraphrase generator.	[13, 40]	[1, 1]	[0.37355154752731323, 1.2629272937774658]
Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[0.8771401047706604]
It is faster because the search problem for noisy- channel models is NP-complete (Knight, 1999), and even the fastest dynamic-programming heuristics used in statistical MT (Niessen et al., 1998; Till- mann and Ney, 2000), are polynomial in J —for in p(v1, w2, wm−1, um|h, s) = stance O(mJ 4V 3) in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).	[1]	[1]	[0.6164431571960449]
It is well known that the number of the instances for each relation type in the ACE RDC corpora is greatly unbalanced (Zhou et al., 2005) as shown in Table 1 for the ACE RDC 2004 corpus.	[149]	[1]	[1.2677743434906006]
Many existing systems for statistical machine translation 1 1 (Garc´ıa-Varea and Casacuberta 2001; Germann et al. 2001; Nießen et al. 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) implement models presented by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each source word position.	[9, 8, 25]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.7314162254333496, 0.39340654015541077, 1.1146330833435059]
Many natural language models can be captured by weighted finite-state transducers (Pereira et al., 1994; Sproat et al., 1996; Knight and AlOnaizan, 1998; Clark, 2002; Kolak et al., 2003; Mathias and Byrne, 2006), which offer several benefits:â€¢ WFSTs provide a uniform knowledge represen tation.	[138]	[1]	[0.530672550201416]
Many verbs are listed in multiple classes, some of which have conflicting sets of syntactic frames.Dang ct al.(1998) showed that multiple listings could in some cases be interpreted as regular sense extensions, and defined intcrsectivc Levin classes, which are a more fine-grained, syntactically and semantically coherÂ­ ent refinement of basic Levin classes.	[4, 15, 29, 26, 44, 30, 0]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.65044367313385, 1.5943387746810913, 1.475937843322754, 1.3944618701934814, 0.8281076550483704, 0.6053189635276794, 1.2010222673416138]
Much of the work involving comparable corpora has focused on extracting word translations (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2000; Gaussier et al., 2004; Shao and Ng, 2004; Shinyama and Sekine, 2004).	[0, 24, 13]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.7503740191459656, 1.7290064096450806, 1.7725189924240112]
No comparable figure has been reported for classical Chinese word segmentation, but this rate compares favorably with past attempts for modern Chinese, e.g., an average of 76% inter- human agreement rate in (Sproat et al., 1996).	[325]	[1]	[0.8382667899131775]
Note a lexicon and a LM are the only needed resources for building a dictionary-based CWS, like the â€œdict-hybrid.â€ (Zhang et al., 2006) We used the â€œdict-hybridâ€ to segment the SMT training corpus and test data.	[78, 143, 43]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.5988103747367859, 0.6996286511421204, 0.7002559304237366]
Och et al. report word error rates of 68.68% for optimal search (based on a variant of the A* algorithm), and 69.65% for the most restricted version of a decoder that combines dynamic programming with a beam search (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).

One example of such approaches is Sproat et al.(1996), which is based on weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).	[-4, 398, 153]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.5322964787483215, 0.7531997561454773, 0.6868136525154114]
One existing method that is based on sub-word information, Zhang et al.(2006), combines a C R F and a rule-based model.	[7, 151]	[1, 1]	[0.35934972763061523, 0.6714439988136292]
One major challenge in relation extraction is due to the data sparseness problem (Zhou et al 2005).	[39]	[1]	[1.0597668886184692]
One of the major problems in unsupervised word segmentation is the treatment of unseen word [Sproat et al., 1996] wrote lexical rules for each productive morphological process, such as plur noun formation, Chinese personal names, and transliterations of foreign words.	[134, 280]	[1, 1]	[0.4805903732776642, 1.480441927909851]
Palmer (1999) and Dang et a!.(1998) argue that the use of syntactic frames and verb classes can simÂ­ plify the definition of different verb senses.	[27, 26, 29]	[1, 1, 1]	[1.017480492591858, 0.4994197189807892, 0.5412089228630066]
Palmer (2000) and Dang et al.(1998) argue that syntactic frames and verb classes are useful for developing principled classifications of verbs.	[40, 174, 27, 42, 29, 6]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.5133389234542847, 1.030394434928894, 0.618375301361084, 0.37878793478012085, 0.8798635005950928, 0.32783210277557373]
Part of the work using this tool was described by (Zhang et al., 2006).The approach was reported to achieve the highest word segmentation accuracy using the data from the second Sighan Bakeoff.	[72, 78, 14, 43]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.5674097537994385, 0.5269709229469299, 0.529355525970459, 0.6765206456184387]
Previous work on prediction at the supersense level (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005) has focused on lexical acquisition (nouns exclusively), thus aiming at word type classification rather than tagging.	[0]	[1]	[0.9719054102897644]
Purely statistical methods of word segmentation (e.g. de Marcken 1996, Sproat et al 1996, Tung and Lee 1994, Lin et al (1993), Chiang et al (1992), Lua, Huang et al, etc.) often fail to identify those words because of the sparse data problem, as the likelihood for those words to appear in the training texts is extremely low.	[124, 125]	[1, 1]	[1.724592924118042, 0.8481010794639587]
Recent work has begun to address relation and event extraction through trainable means, chiefly SVM classification (Zelenko et al, 2003, Zhou et al, 2005).	[33]	[1]	[0.578711211681366]
Recent work on relation extraction has been dominated by feature-based and kernel-based supervised learning methods.Zhou et al.(2005) and Zhao and Grishman (2005) studied various features and feature combinations for relation extraction.	[162]	[1]	[0.5191280245780945]
Recent work on relation extraction has shown that supervised machine learning coupled with intelligent feature engineering or kernel design provides state-of-the-art solutions to the problem (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Qian et al., 2008).	[37]	[1]	[1.3055126667022705]
Recently (Zhang et al., 2006) proposed a maximum subword-based IOB tagger for Chinese word segmentation, and our system applies their approach which obtains a very high accuracy on the shared task data from previous SIGHAN competitions.	[1, 151, 5, 0]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.2590984106063843, 1.4668805599212646, 0.9554219245910645, 0.7188698053359985]
Recently, holistic approaches combining such similarities have been studied (Shao and Ng, 2004; You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011).	[168]	[1]	[1.15906822681427]
Same as Zhou et al (2005), we only model explicit relations and explicitly model the argument order of the two mentions involved.	[123, 22]	[1, 1]	[0.47722145915031433, 0.6504024267196655]
See the details of subword-based Chinese word segmentation in (Zhang et al., 2006)	[0, 151, 25, 5]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.2248268127441406, 0.826906681060791, 0.40367162227630615, 0.874666690826416]
Segmentation rutd morphological analysis related issues of both Chinese and Japanese are intensively addressed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996; MatsUIIt(ltO et al., 1997 and many others).	[340]	[1]	[0.6194199323654175]
Shao and Ng (2004) presented a method to mine new translations from Chinese and English news documents of the same period from different news agencies, combining both transliteration and context information.	[17, 3, 173, 4, 81, 11, 85, 83]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.9763192534446716, 1.4908934831619263, 1.7046693563461304, 0.5005508661270142, 0.9533109664916992, 0.4609949290752411, 0.34458035230636597, 0.5986212491989136]
Similarly, (Sekine, 2005) improved information retrieval based on pattern recognition by introducing paraphrase generation.	[0]	[1]	[0.4235452115535736]
Similarly, Sproat et al.(1996) also uses multiple human judges.	[412]	[1]	[0.7398883700370789]
Some attempts were made to let annotators judge rule correctness directly, that is by asking them to judge the correctness of a given rule (Shinyama et al., 2002; Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[1.457450270652771]
Some of these studies have concentrated on finite-state or extended finite-state machinery, such as (Vilar and others, 1999), others have chosen models closer to context-free grammars and context-free transduction, such as (Alshawi et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2000; Yamamoto and Matsumoto, 2000), and yet other studies cannot be comfortably assigned to either of these two frameworks, such as (Brown and others, 1990) and (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).	[9]	[1]	[1.5308035612106323]
Some recent research used comparable corpora to mine name translation pairs (Feng et al., 2004; Kutsumi et al., 2004; Udupa et al., 2009; Ji, 2009; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Lu and Zhao, 2006; Hassan et al., 2007).	[168, 13]	[1, 1]	[1.5842986106872559, 1.5507423877716064]
Some recent research used comparable corpora to re-score name transliterations (Sproat et al., 2006; Klementiev and Roth, 2006) or mine new word translations (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Tao and Zhai, 2005; Hassan et al., 2007; Udupa et al., 2009; Ji, 2009).	[12, 168, 13]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.3466496467590332, 1.5663342475891113, 1.7244242429733276]
Sproat et al.(1996) employs stochastic finite state machines to find word boundaries.	[0, -4]	[1, 1]	[0.7478364109992981, 0.42321836948394775]
Sproat et al.(1996) implement special recognizers not only for Chinese names and transliterated foreign names, but for components of morphologically obtained words as well.	[399, 383, 280]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.4715484380722046, 0.3425114154815674, 1.21466863155365]
Statistical approaches involve language mod els mostly finite-state ones trained on some large-scale corpora as showed in Fan and Tsai (1988) Chang et al (1991) Chiang et al (1992) Sproat et al (1996)	[124]	[1]	[1.1936026811599731]
Supersense tagging (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005) evaluates a modelâ€™s ability to cluster words by their semantics.	[0, 68]	[1, 1]	[0.730159342288971, 1.0401458740234375]
The Chinese person-name model is a modified version of that described in Sproat et al.(1996).	[458, 242]	[1, 1]	[0.4873383641242981, 0.42588794231414795]
The Chinese word segmentation is a nontrivial task because no explicit delimiters (like spaces in English) are used for word separation.As the task is an important precursor to many natural language processing systems, it receives a lot of attentions in the literature for the past decade (Wu and Tseng, 1993; Sproat et al., 1996).	[53]	[1]	[1.1078180074691772]
The actual implementation of the weighted finiteÂ­ state transducer by Sproat et al.(1996) can be taken as an evidence that the hypothesis of one tokenization per source has already in practical use.	[-4, 138]	[1, 1]	[0.8602296710014343, 0.5254043936729431]
The computational complexity for the left-to-right and right-to-left is the same, O(|E|3m22m ), as reported by Tillmann and Ney (2000), in which |E| is the size of the vocabulary for output sentences 3.	[82, 42]	[1, 1]	[0.8869121670722961, 0.4779382050037384]
The decoding methods presented in this paper explore the partial candidate translation hypotheses greedily, as presented in Tillmann and Ney (2000) and Och et al.	[192, 170, 15, 33]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.0936661958694458, 0.4462072551250458, 1.1374247074127197, 1.3238264322280884]
The features used in Kambhatla (2004) and Zhou et al.(2005) have to be selected and carefully calibrated manually.	[120]	[1]	[0.7609084248542786]
The significance of inference rules has led to substantial effort into developing algorithms that automatically learn inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Schoenmackers et al., 2010), and generate knowledge resources for inference systems.	[40]	[1]	[0.6430130004882812]
The traditional approch to translation extraction from comparable corpora and most of its extensions (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Otero, 2007; Yu and Tsujii, 2009; Marsi and Krahmer, 2010) presuppose the availability of a bilingual lexicon for translating source vectors into the target language.	[21, 49]	[1, 1]	[1.2366745471954346, 0.6657841801643372]
The weighted finite-state transducer model developed by Sproat et al.(1996) is another excellent representative example.	[138, -4, 153]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.42031919956207275, 1.1751844882965088, 0.7031223177909851]
There are many other OOV recognition methods proposed in literature before the rise of machine learning in the field.For example, the Sproat et al.(1996) system can successfully recognize OOVs of strong patterns, such as Chinese personal names, transliterations, using finite-state techniques.	[67]	[1]	[0.45839837193489075]
There are two approaches to solve this problem: to increase the coverage of the dictionary (Fung and Wu, 1994; Chang et al., 1995; Mori and Nagao, 1996) and to design a better model for unknown words (Nagata, 1996; Sproat et al., 1996).	[415, 54]	[1, 1]	[1.6791020631790161, 0.5648363828659058]
These experiments are done using Zhou et al.(2005), TPWF kernel, SL kernel, different versions of proposed KH F kernel and KH ybrid kernel.	[32, 37]	[1, 1]	[0.9196506142616272, 0.5551212430000305]
This article will present a DP-based beam search decoder for the IBM4 translation model.A preliminary version of the work presented here was published in Tillmann and Ney (2000).	[192, 0, 3, 170]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.1953136920928955, 0.8879590630531311, 0.35680022835731506, 0.5102607011795044]
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes (ILCs) (Dang et al., 1998).	[108, 0, 15]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.31846529245376587, 1.1417063474655151, 0.9575112462043762]
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VerbNet lexi con that is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levin classification called Inter- sective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).	[15, 110, 108, 156, 5]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.9809420704841614, 0.8247953057289124, 0.483148455619812, 0.36468493938446045, 0.44080376625061035]
This follows on from the success of these methods in general NLP (see for example Zhou et al (2005)).	[162]	[1]	[0.8669949769973755]
This is a lightweight model and generally does not attempt to exhaustively leverage all possible proven sources of useful features (Zhou et al., 2005) towards a higher absolute score, but rather to serve as a point of comparison to the models which rely on syntactic information.	[31]	[1]	[0.8370897173881531]
This lexicon exploits the systematic link between syntax and semantics that motivates the Levin classes, and thus provides a clear and regular association between syntactic and semantic properties of verbs and verb classes, [Dang, et al, 98, 00, Kipper, et al. 00].	[6, 15, 29, 129]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.8770830035209656, 0.7297024130821228, 0.3582797348499298, 0.3924553394317627]
This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes (Dang et al 1998) refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class	[4, 15, 74, 47, 40, 29, 156]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.488741934299469, 1.358729600906372, 0.49281519651412964, 0.5875568985939026, 0.6666707396507263, 0.9612309336662292, 0.8166563510894775]
This sparked intensive research on unsupervised acquisition of entailment rules (and similarly paraphrases) e.g.(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[0.8038122653961182]
Thus, some research has been focused on deriving different sense groupings to overcome the fineâ€“ grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze, 1993) (Peters et al., 1998) (Mihalcea and Moldo- van, 2001) (Agirre et al., 2003) and on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al., 1997) (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003) (Villarejo et al., 2005) (Curran, 2005) (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).	[148]	[1]	[0.6844545006752014]
To improve word segmentaÂ­ tion accuracy, (Nagata, 1996) used a single general purpose unknown word model, while (Sproat et al., 1996) used a set of specific word models such as for plurals, personal names, and transliterated foreign words.	[170, 280]	[1, 1]	[0.5670498609542847, 0.33296212553977966]
To summarize these experimental tests, we briefly report experimental offline results for the following translation approaches: â€¢ single-word based approach [20];	[171]	[1]	[1.4823380708694458]
Under this constraint, many researchers had contributed algorithms and associated pruning strategies, such as Berger et al.(1996), Och et al.(2001), Wang and Waibel (1997), Tillmann and Ney (2000) GarciaVarea and Casacuberta (2001) and Germann et al.	[15, 122]	[1, 1]	[1.1863731145858765, 0.5319202542304993]
VN is built on a refinement of the Levin classes, the intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998), aimed at achieving more coherent classes both semantically and syntactically.	[4, 156, 110, 5, 47, 6, 40, 0]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.4640147686004639, 1.5237913131713867, 1.1755564212799072, 1.074575424194336, 0.9084963798522949, 0.48470282554626465, 0.3090691864490509, 1.2048561573028564]
Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), tfidf (Fung and Yee, 1998), pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Andrade et al., 2010), context heterogeneity (Fung, 1995), etc. Shao and Ng (2004) represented contexts using language models.	[16]	[1]	[1.7647497653961182]
We agree with Sekine (2005) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases.	[197, 2, 22, 204, 193, 136, 72]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.831343173980713, 0.3500034213066101, 0.5284886360168457, 0.7914794087409973, 1.1662235260009766, 0.346872478723526, 0.7813175320625305]
We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).	[20, 3, 5, 156, 172, 110]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.8582419157028198, 0.6643425822257996, 0.363097220659256, 0.4049023389816284, 0.4629831612110138, 0.5870799422264099]
We also proposed a method to find paraphrases in the context of two Named Entity instances in a large un-annotated corpus (Sekine 05).	[204, 22, 24, 38, 2, 206, 27]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.7296390533447266, 1.0080311298370361, 0.3685739040374756, 0.791746199131012, 0.8171536922454834, 0.3551499843597412, 0.5549951195716858]
We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang et al.(2006) for comparison.	[4]	[1]	[0.8564300537109375]
We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang, Kikui, and Sumita (2006) for comparison.	[4]	[1]	[0.9400787353515625]
We created a hierarchy of actions, exploiting the idea that verbs can be represented in a lattice that allows semantically similar verbs, such as motion verbs or verbs of contact, to be closely associatedwith each other under a common parent that cap tures the properties these verbs all share (Dang et al., 1998).	[111, 153, 114, 73, 6, 161]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.6762261986732483, 1.213674783706665, 1.3580113649368286, 0.6122977137565613, 0.3890078663825989, 0.8313696980476379]
We first adopted the full feature set from Zhou et al.(2005), a state-of-the-art feature based relation extraction system.	[144]	[1]	[0.4941944479942322]
We used a maximum- matching algorithm and a dictionary compiled from the CTB (Sproat et al., 1996; Xue, 2001) to do segmentation	[305]	[1]	[0.5831579566001892]
We used a translation system called â€œsingle- word based approachâ€ described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000) and compared to other approaches in (Ney et al., 2000).	[122, 125, 15, 25]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[1.327752709388733, 0.5833958387374878, 1.5001920461654663, 0.8920428156852722]

3.3.1 Dictionary features Because segmentation using a dictionary alone can serve as a strong baseline in Chinese word segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996), the use of dictionaries is expected to make our joint model more robust and enables us to investigate the contribution of the syntactic dependency in a more realistic setting.

A concept analogous to our notion of meta sense (i.e., senses beyond single words) has been used in previous work on class-based WSD (Yarowsky, 1992; Curran, 2005; Izquierdo et al., 2009), and indeed, the CAM might be used for class-based WSD as well.	[165]	[1]	[-2.9516282081604004]

According to the results reported in (R. Zhang et al., 2006), CRF performs relatively better on Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words while Maximum Probability performs well on IV words, so a model combining the advantages of these two methods is appealing.	[154]	[1]	[-2.9371578693389893]
Although a bit lower than Zhou et al.â€™s result of 55.5 (Zhou et al., 2005), we attribute the difference to our use of a different tokenizer, different parser, and having not used the semantic information features.	[215]	[1]	[-2.5682716369628906]
An extension of this approach is the dynamic programming search of the most probable word combination on the word lattice, such as Ma (1996) and Sproat et al.(1996), which utilize information such as word frequency statistics in a corpus to build the model and are less efficient but more accurate.

To our knowledge, this association measure has not been used yet in translation spotting.It is computed as: (O11 + 1 )(O22 + 1 ) scribed in (Shao and Ng, 2004).	[12]	[1]	[-2.8817310333251953]
Using parallel corpora (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004), e.g., bilingual Wikipedia entries on the same person, renders high accuracy but suffers from high scarcity.To alleviate such scarcity, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Shao and Ng, 2004) explore a more vast resource of comparable corpora, which share no parallel document- or sentence-alignments as in parallel corpora but describe similar contents in two languages, e.g., news articles on the same event.

Using the 495 characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names (Sproat et al., 1996), a sequence of three of more characters from the list was taken as a possible candidate for Chinese.	[33]	[1]	[-2.781280755996704]
Various clues have been considered when computing the similarities: concept class information obtained from a multilingual thesaurus (DeÂ´jean et al., 2002), co-occurrence models generated from aligned documents (Prochasson and Fung, 2011), and transliteration information (Shao and Ng, 2004).

We also performed (5-fold cross validation) experiments by combining the Stage 1 classifier with each of the Zhou et al.(2005)	[5]	[1]	[-2.9056506156921387]
We call this selection of highly probable words observation pruning (Tillmann and Ney 2000).	[59]	[1]	[-2.8867435455322266]
We think that many cases of ambiguÂ­ ous classification of the lexical entry for a verb can be addressed with the notion of intersective sets introduced by Dang et al.(1998).	[1]	[1]	[-2.819556474685669]
We use SVM as our learning algorithm with the full feature set from Zhou et al.(2005).	[36]	[1]	[-2.8713490962982178]
We use a state-of-the-art feature space (Zhou et al., 2005) to represent examples (including all correct examples, erroneous ones and untagged examples) and use MaxEnt as the weight learning model since it shows competitive performance in relation extraction (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) and outputs probabilities associated with each prediction.

We use features developed in part from those described in Zhou et al (2005) and Wang et al (2006).	[93]	[1]	[-2.7413816452026367]
We use the top-10 list of hypothesis provided by the translation system described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000) for rescoring the hypothesis using the ME models and sort them according to the new maximum entropy score.	[122]	[1]	[-1.8676717281341553]
We used Zhou et al.â€™s lexical features (Zhou et al., 2005) as the basis for the features of our system similar to what other researchers have done (Chan and Roth, 2010).	[6]	[1]	[-2.84664249420166]
We used a simple greedy algorithm described in [Sproat et al., 1996].	[328]	[1]	[-2.5999155044555664]
While contextual information is the primary source of information used in WSD research and has been used for acquiring semantic lexicons and classifying unknown words in other languages (e.g., Roark and Charniak 1998; Ci aramita 2003; Curran 2005)	[65]	[1]	[-2.838064432144165]

participants â€” causation, change of state, and others â€” are central not only in theoretical work on lexical semantics, but in computational approaches to the lexicon, as well (e.g.(Pustejovsky, 1991; Dorr, 1993; Wu and Palmer, 1994; Dang et al., 1998)).	[31]	[1]	[-2.830756664276123]
