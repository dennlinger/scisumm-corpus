(Shao and Ng, 2004) rank translation candidates using PH and CX independently and return results with the highest average rank.	[46, 152, 151]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.40724873542785645, 0.7095432877540588, 0.4309810698032379]
(Zhou et al., 2005), our experiments are carried out on explicit relations due to the poor inter-annotator agreement in annotation of implicit relations and their limited numbers.	[110, 22]	[1, 1]	[0.8915957808494568, 0.5576984882354736]
5.2.4 Transliterations of foreign names As described in Sproat et al.(1996): FNs are usually transliterated using Chinese character strings whose sequential pronunciation mimics the source language pronunciation of the name.	[281, 280]	[1, 1]	[1.0174049139022827, 0.5226747393608093]
7 Here, we use the same set of flat features (i.e. word,.entity type, mention level, overlap, base phrase chunk- ing, dependency tree, parse tree and semantic information) as Zhou et al (20 05).	[34]	[1]	[0.4324585795402527]
A number of automatically acquired inference rule/paraphrase collections are available, such as (Szpektor et al., 2004), (Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[1.1132290363311768]
A previous work along this line is Sproat et al.(1996), which is based on weighted finite-state transducers (FSTs).	[87]	[1]	[1.106023907661438]
"According to Sproat et al. {1996) and Wu and Fung {1994), experiments show that only about 75% agreement between native speakers is to be expected on the ""correct"" segmentation, and the figure reduces as more people become involved."	[410, 303, 415, 348]	[1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.3202274441719055, 1.2003028392791748, 0.7961708307266235, 1.0414056777954102]
Also, the CRF model using maximum subword-based tagging (Zhang et al., 2006)	[30]	[1]	[0.6774923205375671]
Although in order to achieve the best performance, it is necessary to use a proper combination of these features (Zhou et al., 2005), in this paper, we will concentrate on how to better capture the syntactic features for relation extraction.	[20]	[1]	[0.4721730053424835]
Among these strategies, the confidence measure used to combine the results of CT and DS is a straightforward one, which is introduced in (Zhang et al., 2006a).	[58, 57]	[1, 1]	[0.5651995539665222, 0.677045464515686]
As even human judges differ when facing the task of segmenting a text into words and test corpora differ from system to system (Sproat et al. 1996), it is very difficult to compare two methods.	[130]	[1]	[0.5882430076599121]
As for paraphrase, Sekineâ€™s Paraphrase Database (Sekine, 2005) is collected using an unsupervised method, and focuses on phrases connecting two Named Entities.	[23, 205]	[1, 1]	[0.587068498134613, 0.587068498134613]
Bag-of-Words: These features have also been explore by Zhao and Grishman (2005) and Zhou et.al.(2005).	[37, 32, 164]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.5979480743408203, 0.6626973748207092, 0.7796167731285095]
Based on his work, Zhou et al (2005)further incorporated the base phrase chunking information and semi-automatically collected country name list and personal relative trigger word list.	[155]	[1]	[0.4125213921070099]
Candidate Chinese transliterations are generated by consulting a list of characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names.As discussed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996), a subset of a few hundred characters (out of several thousand) tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating foreign names into Chinese.	[280]	[1]	[0.37341541051864624]
Chinese According to Sproat et al.(1996), most prior work in Chinese segmentation has exploited lexical knowledge bases; indeed, the authors assert that they were aware of only one previously pubÂ­ lished instance (the mutual-information method of Sproat and Shih (1990)) of a purely statistical apÂ­ proach.	[91]	[1]	[1.0200687646865845]
Dependency Relations and Dependency Paths: These features have been explored by Bunescu and Mooney (2005a), Zhao and Grishman (2005), and Zhou et.al.(2005).	[37, 32]	[1, 1]	[0.5876489877700806, 0.6622213125228882]
Due to space limitations, we only describe the collocation features and refer the reader to (Zhou et al., 2005) for the rest of the features.	[37]	[1]	[0.47367310523986816]
For each pair of entity mentions, we extract and compute various lexical and syntactic features, as employed in a state-of-the-art relation extraction system (Zhou et al., 2005).	[60]	[1]	[1.0583527088165283]
However it is reported (Zhou et al., 2005; Kambhatla, 2004) that hierarchical structured syntactic features contributes less to performance improvement.	[41]	[1]	[0.886225163936615]
In Chinese text segmentation there are three basic approaches (Sproat et al. 1996): pure heuristic, pure statistical, and a hybrid of the two.	[91]	[1]	[0.30984964966773987]
In addition to the model based upon a dictionary of stems and words, we also experimented with models based upon character n-grams, similar to those used for Chinese segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996).	[245]	[1]	[0.410257488489151]
In addition, there is no commonly accepted standard for evaluating the performance of word extraction methods, and it is very hard to decide whether a word is meaningful or not (Sproat et al. 1996).	[191]	[1]	[0.5106399059295654]
Indeed, the prominent approach for evaluating the quality of rule acquisition algorithms is by human judgment of the learned rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Pang et al., 2003; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[0.5497456192970276]
Levin&aposs classification has been extended by other NLP researchers (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dang et al., 1998).	[18]	[1]	[1.0797665119171143]
Many existing systems for statistical machine translation 1 1 (Garc´ıa-Varea and Casacuberta 2001; Germann et al. 2001; Nießen et al. 1998; Och, Tillmann, and Ney 1999) implement models presented by Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993): The correspondence between the words in the source and the target strings is described by alignments that assign target word positions to each source word position.	[9, 25]	[1, 1]	[1.0857187509536743, 0.437547504901886]
Many verbs are listed in multiple classes, some of which have conflicting sets of syntactic frames.Dang ct al.(1998) showed that multiple listings could in some cases be interpreted as regular sense extensions, and defined intcrsectivc Levin classes, which are a more fine-grained, syntactically and semantically coherÂ­ ent refinement of basic Levin classes.	[4, 15, 29]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.45083051919937134, 0.5647943019866943, 0.45413437485694885]
Much of the work involving comparable corpora has focused on extracting word translations (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2000; Gaussier et al., 2004; Shao and Ng, 2004; Shinyama and Sekine, 2004).	[13]	[1]	[1.0628474950790405]
Previous work on prediction at the supersense level (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005) has focused on lexical acquisition (nouns exclusively), thus aiming at word type classification rather than tagging.	[0, 68]	[1, 1]	[0.4653739333152771, 0.6594479084014893]
Purely statistical methods of word segmentation (e.g. de Marcken 1996, Sproat et al 1996, Tung and Lee 1994, Lin et al (1993), Chiang et al (1992), Lua, Huang et al, etc.) often fail to identify those words because of the sparse data problem, as the likelihood for those words to appear in the training texts is extremely low.	[124]	[1]	[1.0749861001968384]
Recent work on relation extraction has shown that supervised machine learning coupled with intelligent feature engineering or kernel design provides state-of-the-art solutions to the problem (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Zhou et al., 2005; Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Qian et al., 2008).	[37]	[1]	[0.7719677686691284]
Recently (Zhang et al., 2006) proposed a maximum subword-based IOB tagger for Chinese word segmentation, and our system applies their approach which obtains a very high accuracy on the shared task data from previous SIGHAN competitions.	[151]	[1]	[0.5167604088783264]
Recently, holistic approaches combining such similarities have been studied (Shao and Ng, 2004; You et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011).	[168]	[1]	[0.6516833305358887]
Same as Zhou et al (2005), we only model explicit relations and explicitly model the argument order of the two mentions involved.	[22]	[1]	[0.3463379442691803]
Shao and Ng (2004) presented a method to mine new translations from Chinese and English news documents of the same period from different news agencies, combining both transliteration and context information.	[3, 173]	[1, 1]	[0.6715584397315979, 0.6451497673988342]
Some attempts were made to let annotators judge rule correctness directly, that is by asking them to judge the correctness of a given rule (Shinyama et al., 2002; Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[1.0667548179626465]
Some recent research used comparable corpora to mine name translation pairs (Feng et al., 2004; Kutsumi et al., 2004; Udupa et al., 2009; Ji, 2009; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Lu and Zhao, 2006; Hassan et al., 2007).	[168]	[1]	[0.6365595459938049]
Some recent research used comparable corpora to re-score name transliterations (Sproat et al., 2006; Klementiev and Roth, 2006) or mine new word translations (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Tao and Zhai, 2005; Hassan et al., 2007; Udupa et al., 2009; Ji, 2009).	[13, 168]	[1, 1]	[0.7052723169326782, 0.7902047634124756]
Sproat et al.(1996) implement special recognizers not only for Chinese names and transliterated foreign names, but for components of morphologically obtained words as well.	[280]	[1]	[0.6336333155632019]
Supersense tagging (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005) evaluates a modelâ€™s ability to cluster words by their semantics.	[68]	[1]	[0.49359360337257385]
The decoding methods presented in this paper explore the partial candidate translation hypotheses greedily, as presented in Tillmann and Ney (2000) and Och et al.	[15, 33]	[1, 1]	[0.5816494822502136, 0.7544354200363159]
The principal work on segmentation has focused either on identifying words in phonetic streams (Saffran, et.al, 1996; Brent, 1996; de Marcken, 1996) or on tokenizing Asian and Indian languages that do not normally include word delimiters in their orthography (Sproat, et al, 1996; Ponte and Croft 1996; Shimohata, 1997; Teahan, et al., 2000; and many others).	[367, 110, 124, 358, 245]	[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]	[0.44844409823417664, 0.7867656350135803, 0.6603063941001892, 0.8814670443534851, 0.9785828590393066]
The significance of inference rules has led to substantial effort into developing algorithms that automatically learn inference rules (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Sekine, 2005; Schoenmackers et al., 2010), and generate knowledge resources for inference systems.	[40]	[1]	[0.701285719871521]
The traditional approch to translation extraction from comparable corpora and most of its extensions (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Shao and Ng, 2004; Otero, 2007; Yu and Tsujii, 2009; Marsi and Krahmer, 2010) presuppose the availability of a bilingual lexicon for translating source vectors into the target language.	[21]	[1]	[0.43312156200408936]
The weighted finite-state transducer model developed by Sproat et al.(1996) is another excellent representative example.	[-4]	[1]	[0.36686691641807556]
There are two approaches to solve this problem: to increase the coverage of the dictionary (Fung and Wu, 1994; Chang et al., 1995; Mori and Nagao, 1996) and to design a better model for unknown words (Nagata, 1996; Sproat et al., 1996).	[415]	[1]	[0.8876188397407532]
This sparked intensive research on unsupervised acquisition of entailment rules (and similarly paraphrases) e.g.(Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; Sekine, 2005).	[40]	[1]	[0.9080474376678467]
Thus, some research has been focused on deriving different sense groupings to overcome the fineâ€“ grained distinctions of WN (Hearst and SchuÂ¨ tze, 1993) (Peters et al., 1998) (Mihalcea and Moldo- van, 2001) (Agirre et al., 2003) and on using predefined sets of sense-groupings for learning class-based classifiers for WSD (Segond et al., 1997) (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003) (Villarejo et al., 2005) (Curran, 2005) (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).	[148]	[1]	[0.6437594294548035]
To summarize these experimental tests, we briefly report experimental offline results for the following translation approaches: â€¢ single-word based approach [20];	[171]	[1]	[0.6009984612464905]
Under this constraint, many researchers had contributed algorithms and associated pruning strategies, such as Berger et al.(1996), Och et al.(2001), Wang and Waibel (1997), Tillmann and Ney (2000) GarciaVarea and Casacuberta (2001) and Germann et al.	[15, 122]	[1, 1]	[1.0360901355743408, 0.7094840407371521]
VN is built on a refinement of the Levin classes, the intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998), aimed at achieving more coherent classes both semantically and syntactically.	[156]	[1]	[0.3145679235458374]
Various correlation measures have been used: log-likelihood ratio (Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002), tfidf (Fung and Yee, 1998), pointwise mutual information (PMI) (Andrade et al., 2010), context heterogeneity (Fung, 1995), etc. Shao and Ng (2004) represented contexts using language models.	[16]	[1]	[1.0639160871505737]
We agree with Sekine (2005) who claims that several different methods are required to discover a wider variety of paraphrases.	[197]	[1]	[1.0417091846466064]
We also plan to experiment with different classification schemes for verb semantics such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and intersective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).	[20]	[1]	[1.1635656356811523]
We also proposed a method to find paraphrases in the context of two Named Entity instances in a large un-annotated corpus (Sekine 05).	[204]	[1]	[0.8231751918792725]
We call this selection of highly probable words observation pruning (Tillmann and Ney 2000).	[166]	[1]	[0.6035922169685364]
We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang et al.(2006) for comparison.	[4, 137]	[1, 1]	[0.6272050738334656, 0.30195531249046326]
We chose the three models that achieved at least one best score in the closed tests from Emerson (2005), as well as the sub-word-based model of Zhang, Kikui, and Sumita (2006) for comparison.	[4, 137]	[1, 1]	[0.7454320192337036, 0.3790633976459503]
We created a hierarchy of actions, exploiting the idea that verbs can be represented in a lattice that allows semantically similar verbs, such as motion verbs or verbs of contact, to be closely associatedwith each other under a common parent that cap tures the properties these verbs all share (Dang et al., 1998).	[114]	[1]	[0.3357038199901581]
We used a translation system called â€œsingle- word based approachâ€ described in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000) and compared to other approaches in (Ney et al., 2000).	[15]	[1]	[0.7524208426475525]
While various machine learning approaches, such as generative modeling (Miller et al 2000), maximum entropy (Kambhatla 2004) and support vector machines (Zhao and Grisman 2005; Zhou et al 2005), have been applied in the relation extraction task, no explicit learning strategy is proposed to deal with the inherent data sparseness problem caused by the much uneven distribution among different relations.	[31]	[1]	[0.49215492606163025]
Word Segmentation accuracy is expressed in terms of recall and precision as is done for bracketing of partial parses [Nagata, 1994, Sproat et al., 1996).	[405]	[1]	[0.4354139566421509]
Word segmentation accuracy is expressed in terms of recall and precision as is done in the previous research (Sproat et al., 1996).	[128, 296, 405]	[1, 1, 1]	[0.5823000073432922, 0.3985714912414551, 0.8381949663162231]
Zhao and Grishman (2005) and Zhou et al.(2005) explored a large set of features that are potentially useful for relation extraction.	[138]	[1]	[0.346952885389328]
Zhou et al (2005) further systematically explored diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic features through support vector machines and achieved F- measure of 68.1 and 55.5 on the 5 relation types and the 24 relation subtypes in the ACE RDC 2003 corpus respectively.	[35]	[1]	[0.3346797227859497]
\tVe think that many cases of amÂ­ biguous classification of verb types can be adÂ­ dressed with the notion of intersedive sets inÂ­ troduced by (Dang ct a!., 1998).	[58]	[1]	[1.0880763530731201]

3.3.1 Dictionary features Because segmentation using a dictionary alone can serve as a strong baseline in Chinese word segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996), the use of dictionaries is expected to make our joint model more robust and enables us to investigate the contribution of the syntactic dependency in a more realistic setting.	[135]	[1]	[-2.0507893562316895]
A concept analogous to our notion of meta sense (i.e., senses beyond single words) has been used in previous work on class-based WSD (Yarowsky, 1992; Curran, 2005; Izquierdo et al., 2009), and indeed, the CAM might be used for class-based WSD as well.	[6]	[1]	[-1.9779090881347656]
A technique that many previous approaches have used is shallow parsing (Koike et al., 2003; Yao et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2005).	[144]	[1]	[-2.0362160205841064]
A variety of features have been explored for ERD in previous research (Zhou et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2008; Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Miller et al., 2000).	[216]	[1]	[-2.01947283744812]
According to the results reported in (R. Zhang et al., 2006), CRF performs relatively better on Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words while Maximum Probability performs well on IV words, so a model combining the advantages of these two methods is appealing.	[154]	[1]	[-2.092726707458496]
After we get word-based segmentation result, we use it to revise the CRF tagging result similar to (Zhang et al., 2006).	[111]	[1]	[-1.964322805404663]
Although a bit lower than Zhou et al.â€™s result of 55.5 (Zhou et al., 2005), we attribute the difference to our use of a different tokenizer, different parser, and having not used the semantic information features.	[215]	[1]	[-2.1112611293792725]
Although we could adapt our method for use with an automatically induced inventory, our method which uses WordNet might also be combined with one that can automatically find new senses from text and then relate these to WordNet synsets, as Ciaramita and Johnson (2003) and Curran (2005) do with unknown nouns.	[75]	[1]	[-2.105156183242798]
Among them, feature-based methods (Kambhatla 2004; Zhou et al., 2005) achieve certain success by employing a large amount of diverse linguistic features, varying from lexical knowledge, entity- related information to syntactic parse trees, dependency trees and semantic information	[18]	[1]	[-1.4686813354492188]
An additional potential is to integrate automatically acquired relationships with the information found in WordNet, which seems to suffer from several serious limitations (Curran 2005), and typically overlaps to a rather limited extent with the output of automatic acquisition methods.	[73]	[1]	[-1.9805420637130737]
An extension of this approach is the dynamic programming search of the most probable word combination on the word lattice, such as Ma (1996) and Sproat et al.(1996), which utilize information such as word frequency statistics in a corpus to build the model and are less efficient but more accurate.	[140]	[1]	[-2.1243722438812256]
Another related task is supersense tagging (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2003; Curran, 2005; Ciaramita and Altun, 2006).	[103]	[1]	[-2.1035077571868896]
As (Sproat ct a.l., 1996) testify, several native Chinese speakers do not always agree on one unique tokeniza.tion for a. given sentence.	[445]	[1]	[-2.082862377166748]
As a later reﬁnement, Sekine (2005) makes a similar attempt at using distributional similarity over named entity pairs in order to produce a list of fully lexicalized phrasal paraphrases for speciﬁc concepts represented by keywords.	[77]	[1]	[-1.8262008428573608]
As discussed elsewhere (Sproat et al., 1996), out of several thousand common Chinese characters, a subset of a few hundred characters tends to be used overwhelmingly for transliterating English names to Chinese, e.g. only 731 Chinese characters are adopted in the E-C corpus.	[338]	[1]	[-1.822391390800476]
As shown in Sproat et al.(1996), the rate of agreement between two human judges is less than 80%.	[136]	[1]	[-1.9347671270370483]
At present, the methods for OOV term translation have changed from the basic pattern based on bilingual dictionary, transliteration or parallel corpus to the intermediate pattern based on comparable corpus (Lee et al., 2006; Shao and Ng, 2004; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003), and 1435 Coling 2010: Poster Volume, pages 1435â€“1443, Beijing, August 2010 then become a new pattern based on Web mining (Fang et al., 2006; Sproat et al., 2006).

The actual implementation of the weighted finiteÂ­ state transducer by Sproat et al.(1996) can be taken as an evidence that the hypothesis of one tokenization per source has already in practical use.	[461]	[1]	[-2.0792951583862305]
The computational complexity for the left-to-right and right-to-left is the same, O(|E|3m22m ), as reported by Tillmann and Ney (2000), in which |E| is the size of the vocabulary for output sentences 3.	[32]	[1]	[-1.9489883184432983]
The decoding algorithm employed for this chunk + weight Ã— j f req(EA j , J j ) based statistical translation is based on the beam search algorithm for word alignment statistical in which Ptm(J|E) and Plm (E) are translationmodel and language model probability, respec translation presented in (Tillmann and Ney, 2000), tively1 , f req(EA j , J j ) is the frequency for the which generates outputs in left-to-right order by consuming input in an arbitrary order.

The features used in Kambhatla (2004) and Zhou et al.(2005) have to be selected and carefully calibrated manually.	[2]	[1]	[-2.080839157104492]
The first utilizes a set of carefully selected features obtained from different levels of text analysis, from part-of-speech (POS) tagging to full parsing and dependency parsing (Kambhatla, 2004; Zhao and Grishman, 2005; Zhou et al., 2005)1.	[3]	[1]	[-2.160088062286377]
The generation of possible output chunks is estimated through an inverted lexicon model and sequences of inserted strings (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).	[23]	[1]	[-2.121131181716919]
The other is multilingual parallel and comparable corpora (e.g., Wikipedia1), wherein features such as co- occurrence frequency and context are popularly employed (Cheng et al., 2004; Shao and Ng, 2004; Cao et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2008).	[4]	[1]	[-2.0135648250579834]
"The problem of the longest match string frequency method is that if a word W1 is a substring of other word w2 and if wl always appears as a substring of w2 in the training text, just like m 1Although (Sproat et al., 1996] calls it ""maximum matching"", we call this method ""longest match"" according to a review on Chinese word segmentation [Wu and Tseng, 1993) and the literal translation of the Japanese name of the method Hi!:."	[426]	[1]	[-2.0064902305603027]
The words were stemmed all possible ways using simple hand-developed affix lists: for example, given a Hindi word c1 c2 c3 , if both c3 and c2 c3 are in our suffix and ending list, then this single word generates three possible candidates: c1 , c1 c2 , and c1c2 c3 . In contrast, Chinese candidates were extracted using a list of 495 characters that are frequently used for foreign names (Sproat et al., 1996).	[336]	[1]	[-2.011270523071289]
Then the feature based method explicitly extracts a variety of lexical, syntactic and semantic features for statistical learning, either generative or discriminative (Miller et al., 2000; Kambhatla, 2004; Boschee et al., 2005; Grishman et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2005; Jiang and Zhai, 2007).

There are a number of popular dictionary-based solutions such as Cha Sen10 and Juman.11 Sproat et al (1996) proposed an alternative solution based on distributional statistics such as mutual information.	[428]	[1]	[-1.6877182722091675]
There are many other OOV recognition methods proposed in literature before the rise of machine learning in the field.For example, the Sproat et al.(1996) system can successfully recognize OOVs of strong patterns, such as Chinese personal names, transliterations, using finite-state techniques.	[20]	[1]	[-1.916852593421936]
There are multiple studies (Wu and Fung, 1994; Sproat et al., 1996; Luo and Roukos, 1996) showing that the agreement between two (untrained) native speakers is about upper to lower	[181]	[1]	[-1.9904290437698364]
There are several commonly used segmentation methods such as forward maximum matching and backward maximum matching(Teahan et al. 2000; Dai, Loh, and Khoo 1999; Sproat et al. 1996).	[307]	[1]	[-2.0366530418395996]
There are, however, approaches to the complementary problem of determining the closest known sense for unknown words (Widdows, 2003; Curran, 2005; Burchardt et al., 2005), which can be viewed as the logical next step after unknown sense detection.	[143]	[1]	[-2.0726680755615234]
There exists stack decoding algorithm (Berger et al., 1996), A* search algorithm (Och et al., 2001; Wang and Waibel, 1997) and dynamic-programming algorithms (Tillmann and Ney, 2000; GarciaVarea and Casacuberta, 2001), and all translate a given input string word-by-word and render the translation in left-to-right, with pruning technologies assuming almost linearly aligned translation source and target texts.	[46]	[1]	[-1.9941539764404297]
These experiments are done using Zhou et al.(2005), TPWF kernel, SL kernel, different versions of proposed KH F kernel and KH ybrid kernel.	[215]	[1]	[-2.1751444339752197]

This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VN lexicon which is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levinâ€™s classification, called Intersective Levin classes (ILCs) (Dang et al., 1998).	[158]	[1]	[-1.4310569763183594]
This constraint of having the same semantic roles is further ensured inside the VerbNet lexi con that is constructed based on a more refined version of the Levin classification called Inter- sective Levin classes (Dang et al., 1998).	[3]	[1]	[-1.160223126411438]
This follows on from the success of these methods in general NLP (see for example Zhou et al (2005)).	[218]	[1]	[-2.1654818058013916]
This is a lightweight model and generally does not attempt to exhaustively leverage all possible proven sources of useful features (Zhou et al., 2005) towards a higher absolute score, but rather to serve as a point of comparison to the models which rely on syntactic information.	[49]	[1]	[-2.002204179763794]
This is slightly behind that of Zhang (2006); the reason might be threefold: i) different data partitioning; ii) different pre-processing; iii) they incorporate features from additional sources, i.e. a phrase chunker, dependency parser and semantic resources (Zhou et al., 2005) (we have on average 9 features/instance, they use 40).	[128]	[1]	[-2.058764934539795]
This lexicon exploits the systematic link between syntax and semantics that motivates the Levin classes, and thus provides a clear and regular association between syntactic and semantic properties of verbs and verb classes, [Dang, et al, 98, 00, Kipper, et al. 00].	[30]	[1]	[-1.5361775159835815]
This may sound simple enough but in reality identifying words in Chinese is a nontrivial problem that has drawn a large body of research in the Chinese language processing community (Fan and Tsai, 1988; Gan et al., 1996; Sproat et al., 1996; Wu, 2003; Xue, 2003).	[-3]	[1]	[-1.9503400325775146]
This reorganization which was facilitated by the use of inter- sective Levin classes (Dang et al 1998) refined the classes to account for semantic and syntactic differences within a class	[27]	[1]	[-1.321329951286316]
Thus, the bigram â€œRAIL ENQUIRIESâ€ gives a misleading probability that â€œRAILâ€ is followed by â€œENQUIRIESâ€ irrespective of what precedes it.This problem happens not only with word-token corpora but also with corpora in which all the compounds are tagged as units since overlapping N- grams still appear, therefore corresponding solutions such as those of Zhang et al.(2006) were proposed.

Tillman and Ney showed how to improve the complexity of the Held-Karp algorithm for restricted word reordering and gave a O (l3m4) ≈ O (m7) algo rithm for French-English translation (Tillman and Ney, 2000).	[2]	[1]	[-2.117614984512329]
To avoid the drawback, several linguistic clues, such as fine-grained classification of named entities and coordinated sentences, have been utilized (Sekine, 2005; Torisawa, 2006).	[18]	[1]	[-2.1671392917633057]
To improve word segmentaÂ­ tion accuracy, (Nagata, 1996) used a single general purpose unknown word model, while (Sproat et al., 1996) used a set of specific word models such as for plurals, personal names, and transliterated foreign words.	[286]	[1]	[-1.9425979852676392]
To our knowledge, this association measure has not been used yet in translation spotting.It is computed as: (O11 + 1 )(O22 + 1 ) scribed in (Shao and Ng, 2004).	[170]	[1]	[-2.1343438625335693]
Using parallel corpora (Kupiec, 1993; Feng et al., 2004), e.g., bilingual Wikipedia entries on the same person, renders high accuracy but suffers from high scarcity.To alleviate such scarcity, (Fung and Yee, 1998; Shao and Ng, 2004) explore a more vast resource of comparable corpora, which share no parallel document- or sentence-alignments as in parallel corpora but describe similar contents in two languages, e.g., news articles on the same event.

Using the 495 characters that are frequently used for transliterating foreign names (Sproat et al., 1996), a sequence of three of more characters from the list was taken as a possible candidate for Chinese.	[133]	[1]	[-2.1252055168151855]
Various clues have been considered when computing the similarities: concept class information obtained from a multilingual thesaurus (DeÂ´jean et al., 2002), co-occurrence models generated from aligned documents (Prochasson and Fung, 2011), and transliteration information (Shao and Ng, 2004).
